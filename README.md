In this challenge, I designed an object-oriented system to manage employees and managers using JavaScript classes. 

This is a simplified employee management system that highlights object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and method overriding. 

My solution used JavaScript class syntax with constructor() functions and super() for inheritance.
